# J4p5Bundle
Symfony Bundle for j4p5

I needed the original j4p5 (http://j4p5.sourceforge.net/) as a Symfony Bundle. That's how far I got.

In the meantime, Hilton Janfield took this a lot further: https://github.com/hiltonjanfield/js4php5

As I'm currently not actively working on this, I'd recommend you check out his repository.
